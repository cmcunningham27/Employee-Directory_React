## Technologies

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT license.

## Complications

## Features
In the future I would like to have links attached to each employee's name that would connect the user to that employees page that would include more in-depth information about themselves. A department column would be a great addition. However, that was not part of the information that was in the Random User API.
